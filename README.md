# KGC-Benchmark

Find out how well a knowledge graph supports link prediction. KGC-Benchmark trains knowledge graph embedding
models on your graph with [PyKEEN](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/) and reports Hits@k and MRR. When you have
several versions of a graph, it shows which version predicts better, relation by relation and query by query.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Point input.json at your graph (see below), then train and evaluate
python KGC.py

# 3. Collect the results of every run into one table, with plots
python report_results.py
```

Run every command from the repository root. A CUDA GPU makes training faster, but you don't need one.

## Your graph

A graph is a tab-separated file with one triple per line: head, relation and tail.

```
E2082	successor	E2102
E1959	predecessor	E150
E1339	spouse	E1690
```

Graphs in N-Triples or another RDF format have to be converted to this format first.

## Configuring a run

`KGC.py` reads its settings from `input.json`. Only two keys are required:

```json
{
  "kg_path": ".data/french_royalty/source/french_royalty.tsv",
  "results_path": "Output/french_royalty/source"
}
```

Add a key only when you want to change its default:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `kg_path` | *required* | The graph to train on |
| `results_path` | *required* | The folder to save the splits, trained models and plots in |
| `models` | `["TransE", "TransH", "TransD", "ComplEx", "RotatE", "TuckER"]` | The [PyKEEN models](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/models.html) to train |
| `num_epochs` | `100` | Training epochs |
| `embedding_dim` | `50` | Embedding size |
| `batch_size` | `1024` | Training batch size |
| `create_inverse_triples` | `false` | Add an inverse of every relation. **CompGCN requires `true`.** |
| `hpo` | `false` | Tune each model's hyperparameters before training it (see below) |

[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) lists every key, including the random seed and the logging
level.

### Tuning hyperparameters

With `"hpo": true`, KGC.py searches each model's embedding size, batch size and other hyperparameters, then
trains the model with the best ones. In this mode, `embedding_dim` and `batch_size` are ignored. Two more keys
control the search:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `n_trials` | `30` | Hyperparameter combinations tried per model |
| `validation_ratio` | `0.1` | Share of the training triples held out to score each combination |

The test split is the same with and without HPO, so the results of both modes can be compared.

## Comparing several graphs

Run `KGC.py` once per graph. Give each run its own `results_path`, with all the versions of a graph in one
shared folder:

```
Output/
└── french_royalty/
    ├── source/              ← the original graph (the reference)
    ├── skgg.std=1.filled/   ← a version to compare with it
    └── pygraft/
```

Then run `python report_results.py`. It writes:

- **`Output/metrics_report.csv`**: Hits@1, 3, 5 and 10 and MRR, with one row per graph and model.
- **`Output/prediction_analysis/`**: the rank of every test prediction, the metrics per relation, and plots
  comparing the reference graph with the other versions.

By default, the reference is the folder named `source` and it is compared query by query with the folders
matching `skgg*`. You can change both settings:

```bash
python report_results.py --reference source --compare "skgg*"
python report_results.py --help    # all options
```

## Origin and license

This project started as the KG completion part of [VANILLA](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/VANILLA), developed by the Scientific Data Management Group at TIB by Disha Purohit and Yashrajsinh Chudasama, supervised by Maria-Esther Vidal. Its history was carried over from that repository.
